      <h5>Welcome to<span class="pro"><br> Bill Doyle's</span><br> Launchpad </h5>


      <p class="text-discription"><span class="pro">WHAT I DID BEFORE:</span> I graduated from Montclair State University, and soon after, I became a Graphic Designer working for The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P) where I helped design food circulars and more. I was very good at it as it only ended because A&P went out of business in 2015.  I spent 18.5 years there and those skill sets earned me wonderful opportunities to work with Ivie & Assoicates in Maryland and Clark Printing in New Jersey for the next few years, as my Digital Resume Website will explain in further detail below. I was fluent in Print Design but as Covid changed everything, I adapted and grew.
      </p>

      <p class="text-discription"><span class="pro">WHAT I AM DOING NOW:</span> With Covid happening in 2020 and as everything shut down, I took that down time to learn and understand Web Design.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Digital Design as I learned on my own in my spare time (on a part time basis) to strengthen my skill sets also.  To pay the bills, I took on jobs as a Personal Shopper which was relatable to me with Advertising and I even earned an Associate of the Month Award at Walmart in March of 2024. Not bad for making the most of any opportunity that was presented to me.  I am adaptable with a very strong work ethic!
